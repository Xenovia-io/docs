## Fine-tuning Overview

<Callout type="info">
  Fine-tuning can significantly improve model performance on specific tasks while potentially reducing token usage and costs.
</Callout>

The fine-tuning process consists of several key components:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Model Selection" icon="robot">
    Choose which models to customize
  </Card>
  <Card title="Dataset Management" icon="database">
    Create and manage training data
  </Card>
  <Card title="Training Jobs" icon="gears">
    Configure and monitor fine-tuning processes
  </Card>
  <Card title="Model Evaluation" icon="magnifying-glass-chart">
    Assess the performance of fine-tuned models
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Model Selection

The Model Selection section helps you choose which models to customize:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Available Models">
    - Browse base models that support fine-tuning
    - Compare model capabilities and specifications
    - Review fine-tuning requirements
    - Check pricing and resource needs
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Model Comparison">
    - Compare performance characteristics
    - Review size and resource requirements
    - Assess fine-tuning suitability
    - Evaluate cost implications
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Selection Guidance">
    - Recommendations based on use case
    - Compatibility with existing systems
    - Performance benchmarks
    - Community feedback and ratings
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout type="tip">
  Start with smaller models for faster iteration and lower costs, then scale up to larger models once your approach is validated.
</Callout>

## Dataset Management

The Dataset Management section allows you to create and manage training data:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Dataset Creation">
    Create new datasets from various sources
  </Step>
  <Step title="Data Preparation">
    Clean, format, and structure your data
  </Step>
  <Step title="Data Validation">
    Verify dataset quality and format
  </Step>
  <Step title="Dataset Versioning">
    Track changes and iterations
  </Step>
</Steps>

Dataset features include:
- Upload existing datasets in various formats
- Create datasets from conversation history
- Generate synthetic training data
- Import from external sources
- Collaborative dataset editing
- Quality scoring and improvement suggestions

## Training Jobs

The Training Jobs section allows you to configure and monitor fine-tuning processes:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
