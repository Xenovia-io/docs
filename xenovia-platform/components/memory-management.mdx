## Memory System Overview

<Callout type="info">
  Effective memory management is crucial for creating agents that maintain context and learn from past interactions.

The memory system in Xenovia is organized into several components:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Memory Stores" icon="database">
    Repositories for different types of information
  </Card>
  <Card title="Memory Entries" icon="note-sticky">
    Individual pieces of stored information
  </Card>
  <Card title="Memory Analytics" icon="chart-line">
    Insights into memory usage and patterns
  </Card>
  <Card title="Memory Configuration" icon="sliders">
    Controls for memory behavior
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Memory Stores

Memory stores are specialized repositories for different types of information:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Conversation Memory">
