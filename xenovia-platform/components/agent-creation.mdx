## Creation Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Basic Information">
    Define the fundamental aspects of your agent
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configuration">
    Set up the operational parameters
  </Step>
  <Step title="Tools Selection">
    Enhance your agent's capabilities
  </Step>
  <Step title="Advanced Settings">
    Fine-tune your agent's behavior
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Basic Information

In this first step, you define the fundamental aspects of your agent:

<Callout type="info">
  A clear purpose and description will help users understand what your agent does and how to interact with it effectively.
</Callout>

- **Name**: Choose a unique identifier for your agent
- **Description**: Provide a detailed explanation of the agent's purpose
- **Purpose**: Define the primary functions and goals
- **Category**: Classify your agent for organization
- **Tags**: Add keywords to improve discoverability
- **Icon**: Select a visual representation

## Configuration

The Configuration step allows you to set up the operational parameters that determine how your agent functions:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Model Selection">
    - Choose the underlying AI model
    - Select model version
    - Configure model-specific settings
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Response Parameters">
    - Set temperature for creativity
    - Configure max tokens for responses
    - Define response formats
    - Set up system messages
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Usage Controls">
    - Configure rate limiting
    - Set usage thresholds
    - Define cost controls
    - Set up usage notifications
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Tools Selection

Enhance your agent's capabilities by connecting it with specialized tools:

  </Card>
  <Card title="API Connectors" icon="plug">
    Connect to external services

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

For each tool, you can:
- Configure tool-specific settings
- Set permissions and access controls
- Define input/output mappings
- Set up error handling

## Advanced Settings

Fine-tune your agent's behavior with specialized configurations:

- **Fallback Responses**: Define what happens when the agent can't provide a direct answer
- **Error Handling**: Configure how errors are managed and reported
- **Conversation Memory**: Set up how the agent remembers past interactions
- **Context Window**: Configure how much conversation history to include
- **Specialized Behaviors**: Define custom behaviors for specific scenarios
- **Integration Settings**: Configure how the agent works with other systems

<Callout type="warning">
  Advanced settings can significantly impact your agent's performance and behavior. Test thoroughly after making changes.
</Callout>
