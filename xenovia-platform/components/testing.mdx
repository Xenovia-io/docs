## Testing Overview

<Callout type="info">
  Comprehensive testing is essential for building reliable AI agents that perform consistently across different scenarios.
</Callout>

The testing system in Xenovia offers several approaches to validation:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Test Case Management" icon="folder-tree">
    Create and organize test scenarios
  </Card>
  <Card title="Test Execution" icon="play">
    Run tests against your agents
  </Card>
  <Card title="Results Analysis" icon="magnifying-glass-chart">
    Evaluate test outcomes
  </Card>
  <Card title="Specialized Testing" icon="flask">
    Address specific evaluation needs
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Test Case Management

The Test Case Management section allows you to create and organize test scenarios:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Test Creation">
    - Define inputs and expected outputs
    - Set evaluation criteria
    - Configure test parameters
    - Add test metadata and descriptions
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Test Organization">
    - Group related tests into suites
    - Tag tests by purpose or feature
    - Set test priorities
    - Manage test dependencies
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Test Maintenance">
    - Update tests as requirements change
    - Version control for test cases
    - Archive obsolete tests
    - Clone and modify existing tests
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Test Scheduling">
    - Set up automated test runs
    - Configure test frequency
    - Define trigger conditions
    - Set notification preferences
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Test Execution

The Test Execution section allows you to run tests against your agents:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Test Selection">
    Choose which tests or test suites to run
  </Step>
  <Step title="Execution Configuration">
    Set parameters for the test run
  </Step>
  <Step title="Execution Monitoring">
    Track progress in real-time
  </Step>
  <Step title="Results Collection">
    Gather and organize test outcomes
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="tip">
  Use parallel test execution to run multiple tests simultaneously and reduce overall testing time.
</Callout>

Execution features include:
- Manual or scheduled execution
- Batch processing for multiple tests
- Environment selection (dev, staging, production)
- Resource allocation controls
- Timeout and retry settings

## Results Analysis

The Results Analysis section helps you evaluate test outcomes:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Results Dashboard" icon="gauge">
    Overview of test performance
  </Card>
  <Card title="Failure Analysis" icon="bug">
    Detailed examination of test failures
  </Card>
  <Card title="Trend Analysis" icon="chart-line">
    Performance changes over time
  </Card>
  <Card title="Comparison View" icon="code-compare">
    Side-by-side result comparison
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Analysis capabilities include:
- Success/failure statistics
- Performance metrics (time, resources)
- Error categorization
- Root cause identification
- Historical comparison
- Export and reporting
