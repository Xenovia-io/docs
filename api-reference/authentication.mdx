## Authentication

All API requests must include an authentication token in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer <your-token>
```

The token can be obtained from the Xenovia platform.

## Rate Limiting

The API has a rate limit of 100 requests per minute per user. If you exceed this limit, you will receive a `429` response.

## Error Handling

All API responses include an `error` field that provides additional information about the error.

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "INVALID_REQUEST",
    "message": "Invalid request parameters"
  }
}
```
