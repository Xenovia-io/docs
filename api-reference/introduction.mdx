Xenovia's API is designed with the following principles:

- **RESTful Design** - Follows REST principles with resource-oriented URLs
- **JSON Formatted** - Uses JSON for all data exchange
- **Secure by Default** - All requests are made over HTTPS with authentication
- **Versioned** - Maintains backward compatibility through versioning

## Base URL
